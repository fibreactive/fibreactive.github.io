Here is a list of some of projects I have worked on and deployed.

* [A mini blog](https://go-articlelate.herokuapp.com) 
	+ I learnt about the MVC framework for structuring web projects.
	+ This was built using Go and Gin framework.
	+ I implmented CRUD operations with mongodb as a database.
	+ I implemented Authentication and Authorization using JWT.
	+ I deployed the app to heroku
      
* [An image sharing platform](https://imagepload.herokuapp.com)
	+ This was built using Javascript.
	+ It is an image sharing site, kind of like a lazy clone of imgur.
	+ I learnt how to manage user uploads and media files.
	+ I learnt more complex mongodb queries.
	
*  [A real time chat application](https://shattop.herokuapp.com)
	+ This was built using Go ( no web framework).
	+ I learnt about websockets and implemented a real time chat application.
	+ I learnt Go's concurrency idiom.
	+ I used PostgreSQL as my database of choice.
