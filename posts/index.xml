      <description>I have been flirting with go for a few weeks now and I built a simple forum-like website using gin which is a popular web framework for golang. After building the application, I was satisfied with how much I was able to learn about the language so I decided to do another little project with it. While I was browsing the web mindlessly(like most of us do), I stumbled upon a comment that talked about web scrapping in python then an idea popped in my mind, why not scrape the frontpage of a popular online forum then use the data to populate my own database.</description>
